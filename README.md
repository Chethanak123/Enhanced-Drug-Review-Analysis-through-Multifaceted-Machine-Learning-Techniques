# Drug Recommendation System
 
The surge in online medication purchases has heightened public awareness of health issues, yet concerns persist regarding medication errors due to limited doctor experiences. To mitigate this, we propose a drug recommendation system leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Our system analyzes user-generated reviews to predict drug suitability, aiding accurate prescription decisions and reducing errors using the reviews provided by the consumers. By employing machine learning classification algorithms, our platform not only recommends drugs based on reviews but also facilitates informed medication choices for users, potentially alleviating the burden on specialists and improving patient outcomes. In a related study, we explore sentiment analysis of drug reviews, focusing specifically on birth control medications. Utilizing a dataset comprising reviews of ten commonly used birth control drugs, we employ various natural language processing techniques, including text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization. Sentiment analysis is conducted using TextBlob, and a Stacking Classifier model is deployed to classify drug effectiveness based on sentiment. Our research aims to uncover sentiment trends surrounding birth control medications and evaluate user-perceived effectiveness, contributing valuable insights to healthcare decision-making processes. This study showcases the application of advanced NLP and ML techniques in analyzing user-generated drug reviews, offering a comprehensive understanding of sentiment in the healthcare domain.
